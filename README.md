# Insurance App - Kotlin Compose

## Description

This is a modern Android insurance application built with Jetpack Compose, following Material Design 3 principles. The app provides a clean interface for users to browse and manage insurance products.

## Key Features

- **Edge-to-Edge Design**: The app utilizes `enableEdgeToEdge()` to maximize screen real estate with a modern full-screen experience.
- **Material Theming**: Implements a custom `TestTheme` for consistent styling throughout the application.
- **Responsive Layout**: Uses Compose's `Column` with `fillMaxSize()` modifier to create adaptive layouts.
- **Clean UI**: Features a light background (`#FFFAFAFA` - "Harble White") for better readability and aesthetic appeal.

## Technical Implementation

- Built with **Jetpack Compose** for declarative UI development
- Uses `ComponentActivity` as the base activity
- Modular screen structure with `AppScreen` composable
- Proper spacing with padding modifiers (top: 5dp, bottom: 24dp)

## Screens

1. **Main Screen**: Displays "Insure Products" heading with a clean white background
2. **Product List**: (To be implemented) Will show available insurance options.
